# üåÄ Claude-Code-Kickstarter

<img style="display: block; margin: 10px auto;" src="logo.png" alt="Claude Code Kickstarter Logo" height="400">

_The one-file setup that drops a full "plan ‚Üí tests ‚Üí code ‚Üí docs ‚Üí PR" workflow into **any** Git repo‚Äîpowered by Claude Code._

---

## ‚ú® What is this?

Inside this repo you'll find **one magic Markdown file**:

```
.claude/commands/setup-claude-workflow.md
```

Copy that file into _any_ existing project (monorepo, single package, JavaScript, Bun, TypeScript‚Äîdoesn't matter).
Then run:

```bash
/user:setup-claude-workflow "My Awesome Project"
```

Claude will:

1. **Detect** which canonical docs you already have.
2. **Write** the missing ones (architecture diagram stub, glossary, API guide, ADR README, onboarding checklist).
3. **Drop** a battle-tested `CLAUDE.md` that enforces:

   - _Branch ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Tests ‚Üí Code ‚Üí Verify ‚Üí Docs ‚Üí Changelog ‚Üí PR_

4. **Install** repo-local helper commands (`/project:regen-docs`, `/project:next`, etc.).
5. **Merge** a minimal GitHub Actions workflow if you don't have one.
6. Stage everything with `git add` and politely remind you to commit.

No `git init`, no history rewrite, no yak-shaving.

| **.claude/commands/**           | Repo-local helper prompts.                                                 |

Already got a `CLAUDE.md`?
_The setup command will **not** overwrite it._
Instead, it prints a diff and offers to run `/user:upgrade-claude-policy` which merges the new policy/table into your file.

## üõ°Ô∏è Recommended tool permissions

Add these to `~/.claude/settings.json` once and forget about permission prompts:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": ["Bash(pnpm:*)", "Bash(bun:*)", "Bash(git:*)", "Bash(gh:*)"],
    "deny": []
  }
}
```

Feel free to swap `pnpm` for `npm` or `yarn`‚ÄîClaude will ask if it can't find a script.

## ü§î FAQ

**Q: My monorepo has many packages‚Äîcan each one have its own README and CLAUDE.md?**

> Yep. Doc-keeper treats `packages/*/README.md` and `packages/*/CLAUDE.md` as "ask-before-update" docs.
> Add package-specific tech-stack notes there and Claude will respect them.

**Q: What if I hate Mermaid?**

> Swap the guideline in `CLAUDE.md` to PlantUML or draw\.io links‚ÄîDoc-keeper will follow your rule.

**Q: Does this work with Sonnet?**

> It'll work‚Äîjust slower and dumber. Run `/model opus` once; worth the extra pennies.

## ü•≥ Contribute

PRs welcome! Ideas:

- Add a Bun-native CI template.
- Include a Playwright smoke-test step.
- More custom commands? PR the prompt file.

Just keep prompts **short & snappy**‚ÄîClaude likes imperative prose.

Happy **plan-test-code-docs** looping! If you ship something cool with this workflow, tweet @you and brag. üéâ
